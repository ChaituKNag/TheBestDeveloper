  - workTitle: My Portfolio Site (this one)
    workDescription: >-
      About a year ago, I thought I should start looking at options to create my
      own developer portfolio site.


      Went through many technical stacks and finally chose Gatsby.js.


      Here is what I used:


      * Gatsby.js (internally uses GraphQL)

      * React Spring

      * Netlify hosting

      * NetlifyCMS for headless content management

      * Styled components (CSS in JS strategy)

      * Gatsby Image Sharp for image optimisation

      * PropTypes for type-checking in the application

      * React Helmet for SEO header meta controls.

      * Prettier, ESLint for code quality

      * Lighthouse CI performance testing

      * MDX - markdown react components
