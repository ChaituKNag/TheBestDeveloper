## Form fields

At the moment, I do not have as many usecases for the form elements as some other types of component. I barely have one form in my site, which is the contact form that I newly added to my site.

All the fields I am using currently are the `input[type='text']`, `textarea` and of course the buttons. So I am not covering other form elements just yet.

## Simple text field

No need to always use a label. Context of the page, sectino, placeholder and title of the form sometimes help achieve the same effect without label.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Text Field">
    <Input type="text" placeholder="placeholder text" />
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Text field with label

But well, for technical purposes, a label is still supported.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Text Field with Label">
    <Label>I am a label</Label>
    <Input type="text" placeholder="placeholder text" />
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Textarea

And here is the text-area field useful to provide more information.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Textarea">
    <Label>Give me your message:</Label>
    <Textarea placeholder="This is going on really cool." />
  </Story>
</Preview>
