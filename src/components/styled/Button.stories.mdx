## Default button

This is a general purpose button.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Default">
    <Button>Hello World</Button>
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Outline button

This is useful in those places where you want to downgrade the emphasis on the button itself, may be you want user to take note of something else, and only take notice of this button barely.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Outline">
    <OutlineButton>Outlined button</OutlineButton>
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Solid button

This is a very powerful grab-attention kind of button. You would use this bring user's attention immediately to it.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Solid">
    <SolidButton>This is a solid button</SolidButton>
  </Story>
</Preview>
